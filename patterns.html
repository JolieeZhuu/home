			<h1>&loz;The Circadian Rhythm&loz;</h1>
			<p>Scientists once believed that the evolution of life on Earth was taken to full advantage by both animals and plants, and they have evolved into all possible behaviors, adaptations, and conditions. Many organisms had evolved into <a href="glossary-cites.html">nocturnal</a> animals to seek protection, and especially in arid zones, organisms try to stay cool and preserve water. Others adapted to <a href="glossary-cites.html">diurnal</a> features, to collect light and warmth. With this variety in behavior, diurnal and nocturnal animals faced less competition.</p>
			<p>The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that determines the sleeping and eating patterns of animals and plants. There are many different cycles, but the most common one is the sleep-wake cycle. Some factors that influence these cycles and patterns are the organisms&rsquo; body temperatures and their cell generation, however the main factor is light.</p>
			<h2>Factors</h2>
			<p>Light is the most important factor. It influences the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is a section of the brain that controls an animal&rsquo;s circadian rhythms, meaning that it also determines whether an animal is diurnal or nocturnal. Depending on the amount of light the animal is exposed to over time, patterns may vary. For example, increased levels of moonlight have been shown to increase the activity of owl monkeys during the night, which leads to a decrease in daytime activity. Owl monkeys were once all diurnal, but have evolved nocturnal adaptations.</p>

			<p>Temperature, food availability, and predation risks are also key factors that may change biological patterns in animals (and plants).</p>
			<p>If the effects of these factors are strong enough, internal biological cycles and patterns can alter and change, in order to find a balance between all factors. For example, diurnal animals adapt to nocturnal features to live in cooler temperatures (especially in arid areas), while nocturnal animals may adapt to diurnal features to live in warmer temperatures.</p>
			<p>There are 4 kinds of biological rhythms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Circadian Rhythm: The 24-hour cycle that regulates physiological and behavioral rhythms such as sleeping</li>
				<li>Diurnal Rhythm: The circadian rhythm that&rsquo;s synchronized with the day/night cycle</li>
				<li>Ultradian Rhythm: A biological rhythm that has a shorter period and higher frequency than circadian rhythms</li>
				<li>Infradian Rhythm: A biological rhythm that lasts more than 24 hours, like the menstrual cycle</li>
			</ol>

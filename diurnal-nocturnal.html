			<h2>Nighttime Wanderers</h2>
			<p>Nocturnal (adj.): An animal or plant that is active at night, and sleeps during the day.</p>
			<!--Hover cursor over something and text appears-->
			<div class="show facts"><h3>Fun Fact!</h3></div>
			<div class="hide"><p class="facts">Plants that bloom at night are described as nocturnal, and the time that they bloom is often in relation to their nocturnal pollinators.</p></div>
			<h3>Adaptations to the Night</h3>
			<p>Like diurnals, nocturnals are active at night to hunt, mate, seek protection from predators (who are most likely diurnals), and to avoid heat, because it is cooler than the night.</p>
			<h3>Properties and Traits of Nocturnal Animals</h3>
			<p>Nocturnal animals have <a href="#special_eyes">special eyes</a> compared to diurnal animals, that allow them to see clearly during the dark. They also have larger eyes and extremely dilated pupils to help them absorb the greatest amount of light possible. However, nocturnal creatures can't just rely on sight to sense their surroundings.</p>
			<p>Nocturnal animals have cupped ears, allowing them to collect a lot more sound than a diurnal animal. (Try cupping your ears; you should be able to hear more clearly than if your ears weren’t cupped.) There is also something called asymmetrical hearing, where each ear of an animal can hear separate things, which allows nocturnals to know their surroundings. (Try cupping only one of your ears and see the effects.) An example would be the ears of owls. They are located in different areas on the sides of their heads, and owls have incredible hearing. Cats are another example, with their always-moving extremely sensitive cupped ears.</p>
			<p>Nocturnal animals can also have amazing <a href="glossary-cites.html">olfactory</a> senses (does not include birds). In the roof of the mouth is where the Jacobson’s organ is located, which is how these animals have such sensitive noses. If the animal were to pull back its lips and grimace, their sense of smell would enhance, as the organ&rsquo;s sensitivity would enhance too. Foxes and raccoons are examples of nocturnal animals that have extraordinary olfactory senses, and when compared to the raw human eye (<a href="https://share.upmc.com/2019/01/screen-time/#:~:text=Spending%20too%20many%20hours%20staring,which%20can%20cause%20added%20strain.">untampered by screens</a>), we are as good as seeing things as they are smelling. </p>
			<p>Taste is related to the olfactory system, as the nose does influence taste. Taste is used by animals to &ldquo;taste&rdquo; the air, and sense their surroundings. Snakes, for example, are professionals at using this, in order to locate their prey.</p>
			<p>Special hairs are another feature for both diurnal and nocturnal animals. These hairs are stimulated by heat, light, and many more factors, which helps animals scavenge and find safety. There are a variety of &ldquo;hairs&rdquo; that are on many creatures, such as cats and their whiskers, and spiders (tarantulas) and their furriness.</p>
			<p>But it’s not just the old 5 senses that nocturnal animals have. There’s also the use of echolocation, or, sonar sounds, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/infrared-vision/">infrared vision</a>, and bioluminescence. </p>
			<p>An animal uses echolocation by producing high pitched <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/u11l1c.cfm">sound waves</a> from the mouth, that bounce off of all nearby objects in its surroundings, and return to the animal in their ears. These animals must have excellent hearing or some other kind of sense to be able to tell the difference between large, small, near, and distant objects. Larger objects give off higher intensity waves while smaller objects give off lower intensities. Nearby objects give off higher pitches, while distant objects give off lower pitches. A common example of an animal using echolocation is the bat, where it also has large, cupped ears to hear greater distances.</p>
			<p>Bioluminescence is when an organism can produce its own light. Bioluminescence is used for communication, locating food, attracting prey, and protection. An example of communication is from fireflies (aka lightning bugs), who use flashing patterns of &ldquo;lights off&rdquo; and &ldquo;lights on&rdquo; to communicate with others. Locating food may just mean attracting prey, and some animals that attract prey using bioluminescence are anglerfish and dragon fish, where their prey is usually attracted to glowing light. (They are also located somewhere near or in the twilight zone where everything is extremely dark, because sunlight can’t reach an area so deep and distant from the surface.) As for self-defense, animals such as jellyfish use bioluminescence to startle their predators with light, and possibly distract them too, so they have time to run away.</p>

			<h3 id="special_eyes">More About How Nocturnal Animals Can See in the Dark</h3>
			<p>Nocturnal animals have different eyes compared to diurnal animals, which is why they can see better during the night. Most nocturnal creatures have tubular eyes and their eye lenses are located closer to the retina, providing more &ldquo;light collection&rdquo;. Behind the retina, there is a reflective layer called the tapetum; light passes through the retina, bounces off of the tapetum, and passes through the retina again. This gives the retina cells a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; to see the image, and this mirror affect is why nocturnal animals&rsquo; eyes glow in the dark.</p>
			<p>Generally, the retina of a species is composed of rod and cones, which are two different types of light-collecting cells. Cones require lots of concentrated, bright light to sense colour, while rods can sense images with dim, scattered light. These rods contain DNA that can make the nuclei in the cells turn into light-collecting cells. Another special eye feature of nocturnal animals comes into play: the majority of the retina is composed of rods. More rods provide more of that nocturnal vision that nighttime creatures require, however, they do not experience the world of colour.</p>
			<h3>Advantages of Being Nocturnal</h3>
			<h4>Predation</h4>
			<p>Nocturnality is a <a href="glossary-cites.html">crypsis</a> that can help animals hide away from predators, but also help predators ambush their prey. As it is still difficult to detect animals during the night, even with heightened senses, prey use this to their advantage, covering themselves in darkness. However, predators also use this to their advantage, mimicking their prey to hunt them more easily. Turtles lay their eggs during the night to avoid their diurnal predators. This allows their offspring to have a chance at life. Lions are <a href="glossary-cites.html">cathemeral</a>, and they choose to hunt at night because their prey are diurnal.</p>
			<h4>Competition</h4>
			<p>Species may also develop nocturnal adaptations to diminish conflicts and competition between other animals. This allows both species to survive and stay in their habitat &minus; instead of moving out and finding another area that may or may not have enough resources &minus; because they are hunting and sleeping at different times.</p>
			<h4>Water Conservation and Cool Temperatures</h4>
			<p>In dry, hot biomes, many animals prefer to be active during the night to preserve precious water, and to avoid the heat during the day. Plants specifically, are mostly nocturnal (in desert biomes), because they need to preserve their water to survive, and blooming during the night prevents them from getting harmed by the heat of the day. Especially with global warming and climate change occurring, diurnal species are somewhat &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to change their activity patterns in order to feel comfortable in their environment, so their solution is to evolve nocturnal adaptations to live in cooler temperatures.</p>
			<h3>Human Disturbances</h3>
			<h4>Light Pollution</h4>
			<p>Light pollution is a major threat towards nocturnal animals. City light can change the overall behavior of animals &minus; affecting their migration patterns, mating choice, and nest site selection &minus; and causing confusion. It’s no doubt that such bright light harms the sensitive eyes of nocturnals. Some animals are attracted to light because that’s their food, but if it turns out to be artificial light, it may cause many casualties (from insects being burned by the heat, to birds flying into buildings). This goes the same for glass buildings and animals that fly, whether it’s during the day or night. An example of confusion would be sea turtles and their offspring; lights  are potentially placing their offspring in danger, because the buried eggs are revealed, and offspring may move towards areas with bright light, instead of the ocean. As well, more lighting around the world means that there is more &ldquo;daytime,&rdquo; and diurnal animals are taking advantage of this to hunt for longer periods of time. This is <a href="glossary-cites.html">deleterious</a> for the nocturnal population, and may decrease the population of nocturnal prey.</p>
			<h4>Spatial Disturbance</h4>
			<p>Humans also take away the habitats of animals and plants, in a way that causes spatial disturbance. The most common method of adapting to this is for species to evolve nocturnal features, to avoid humans during the day. However, there is another solution that is problematic: species move to different habitats where humans do not exist. These habitats may be out of the species&rsquo; comfort zone, being an area that is generally poorer than what they’re used to, and having fewer resources.</p>
			<h4>Domesticated and Encages</h4>
			<p>Having zoos and domestic pets are amazing things to have, especially if we get to understand more about the animals (and plants), but the organisms have to change their biological patterns to fit in with their environment. In zoos, animals have to follow the human sleep-wake cycle, so that they are awake and active when people come to visit. As for (exotice) pets, such as hedgehogs and sugar gliders, they have to follow their owners’ routines and adapt/react to their environment, knowing what time they get fed, when the best time to sleep is, et cetera.</p>
